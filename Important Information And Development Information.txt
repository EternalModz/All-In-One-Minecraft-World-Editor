—-———————————————Where the development will take place————————————————-
On Discord of course, the GitHub repo is where all of the files and code will be stored, but Discord is where we are going to talk and stuff

Development Server *ONLY for those who want to join the developmnt team* (Discord)
https://discord.gg/ACbVxTrT39

Support us on our main server (Community on Discord)
https://discord.gg/8GeJNESRAq

Rules for the development server
1. Help everyone out and don't judge anyone based off of what they can or cannot do
2. Follow Discord’s general rules and TOS
3. Have fun
Note that we fully support everyone and all genders, ages, sexual orientations, identities, pronouns, etc
—-———————————————Plans————————————————-

For now the plans are quite simple. These have recently changed and they may be changed more in the future.

1 - Create a GitHub repository 
2 - Fill out the needed information (plans, licensing, details, plans and milestones) and submit it to the repository 
3 - Gather new members and get to know each other. After that, everyone talk things out and officially start the project (come up with names, icon ideas, concepts, etc)
4 - Start development and talk to each member to assign roles according to skills and preferences
5 - Talk to each other, collaborate and come up with ideas while working on the project
6 - Once finished with the little pieces, we put them together into one main project
7 - We start polishing everything up
8 - We finish and finalize everything
9 - We release it
10 - *This part is optional* We promote the program through social media and so on and so forth
